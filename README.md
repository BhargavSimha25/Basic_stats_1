# Basic Statistics in Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Basic Statistics in Machine Learning** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental statistical concepts that are crucial for understanding and implementing machine learning models.

## üìö Overview

Statistics is the backbone of machine learning, providing the tools and methodologies to understand data, identify patterns, and make predictions. Whether you're new to machine learning or looking to solidify your understanding of the statistical foundations, this repository offers a wealth of resources and practical examples.

### Key Concepts
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Techniques for summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset, including measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation).
- **Probability Distributions:** Understanding common distributions like normal, binomial, and Poisson, and their roles in modeling data.
- **Inferential Statistics:** Methods for making predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.
- **Correlation & Causation:** Distinguishing between correlation and causation, and understanding measures like Pearson's correlation coefficient.
- **Regression Analysis:** An introduction to linear and logistic regression as tools for modeling relationships between variables.
