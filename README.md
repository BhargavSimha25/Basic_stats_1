# Basic Statistics in Machine Learning 📊

Welcome to the **Basic Statistics in Machine Learning** repository! This project serves as a foundational resource for understanding and applying essential statistical concepts that are crucial in the field of machine learning.

## 📝 Overview

Statistics form the backbone of many machine learning algorithms. Understanding these concepts allows data scientists and machine learning practitioners to make informed decisions, interpret models, and improve their performance. This repository covers fundamental statistical techniques and how they apply to machine learning.

## 📚 Contents

### 1. **Descriptive Statistics** 📈
   - **Mean, Median, Mode:** Understand the central tendency of your data.
   - **Variance & Standard Deviation:** Measure the spread or dispersion of your data points.
   - **Skewness & Kurtosis:** Analyze the shape of your data distribution.

### 2. **Probability Theory** 🎲
   - **Probability Distributions:** Explore common distributions like Normal, Binomial, and Poisson.
   - **Bayes’ Theorem:** Learn how to update the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence.
   - **Law of Large Numbers & Central Limit Theorem:** Understand the behavior of averages and the significance of sample sizes.

### 3. **Inferential Statistics** 🔍
   - **Hypothesis Testing:** Conduct tests like t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to make data-driven decisions.
   - **Confidence Intervals:** Calculate the range within which a population parameter lies with a certain level of confidence.
   - **P-Values:** Assess the significance of your results.

### 4. **Correlation & Regression** 📉
   - **Correlation:** Measure the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables.
   - **Simple Linear Regression:** Understand the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extend the analysis to multiple predictors.

### 5. **Dimensionality Reduction** 🧮
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduce the number of variables while retaining most of the data’s variability.
   - **Factor Analysis:** Identify the underlying relationships between variables by grouping them into factors.

### 6. **Data Visualization** 📊
   - **Histograms & Box Plots:** Visualize data distributions and detect outliers.
   - **Scatter Plots:** Explore relationships between variables.
   - **Heatmaps & Correlation Matrices:** Visualize complex relationships and dependencies in data.
